∂Recently, while falling asleep, I realized I wanted to put together a book of interviews — a book of interviews with musicians, to be more precise. And not just free-range interviews. These would center around a single, apparently simple question: “what was your first instrument?” (§:intro)

Around the same time, I learned how to make animated gifs in Photoshop, which quickly became my favorite hobby. Soon the two ideas dovetailed: I could make animated gifs of people playing imaginary instruments. (§:intro)

But therein lied a problem. Books don’t have support for animated gifs. (§:intro)

So here’s this website instead. (§:intro)

And now, a brief interview with myself... (§:intro)

##### What was the last thing you listened to?

Good question. (And one that will be asked at the top of every interview.) Hmm. The last thing I listened to was... _consulting Spotify..._ “[Hamadoun Toure](/sound/hamadoun-toure.mp3)” by Toumani and Sidiki Diabaté, a pair of brothers who are — if Wikipedia is to be believed — 71st-generation _kora_ players in Mali. Really amazing music.

##### What was your first instrument?

The summer before fourth grade, I came home from some kind of sports activity and, not that I can remember why, put the Beatles’ _Hard Day’s Night_ on the family stereo. Before that moment I had no real awareness of music. After that moment I’ve thought about music pretty much constantly.

Probably within a week of that listening, I went up and mined my dad’s old acoustic guitar from the attic. He never played the thing, which both gave it extra mystique, and allowed me to convince myself that — within a day — I had learned how to play “Eight Days a Week” pretty much perfectly.

Ever since, I’ve been playing guitar on and off for close to 20 years.

##### What kind of guitar was it?

A really beautiful Martin Triple-O, built sometime right after World War II, to judge by the serial number inside. In the 1970s my dad was a banjo instructor at a lute shop in northern Virginia. He found the Martin there, in the attic, sometime in the 70s, and asked the staff if he could have it. I think he paid them a small amount for it.

That said, my dad has never gotten great at guitar — he’s excellent at banjo and is fluent on dobro. The Martin moved along with the family, but was only exhumed from its case every once and a while, like when my older brother’s friend did his best Kurt Cobain Unplugged imitation on it for a couple months. Which is why the guitar sounds amazing but looks like hell — deep scratch marks all across the face; he really went wild with the guitar pick.

##### Where’s that guitar now?

I had it for a while when I lived in Boston, but these days it’s back with my parents, in Cleveland.

##### Who will be featured on this site?

Anyone who plays an instrument — professionals to amateurs. Though probably not people who don’t play instruments well, of course.

##### Do you take requests?

Yes, that would be awesome. And feel free to request yourself. Email me at rob.stenson@gmail.com.
