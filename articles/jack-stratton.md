∂Jack Stratton is the band leader of [Vulfpeck](http://vulfpeck.com/) and the founder of Vulf Records, a small record label originally set up to distribute Vulfpeck records. In Vulfpeck, you’ll hear Jack playing any number of instruments: drums, guitar, keyboard. (§:intro)

I interviewed Jack in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of Los Angeles, at his home, which is on the side of a hill and hidden from the street. While I sat on his patio at a long cork table, Jack cooked greens on an Presto electric griddle and answered my questions. (§:intro)

##### What was the last thing you listened to?

ƒ«img:/img/walker.gif» (§:face) [Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah%5FWalker) 

 “[I’ll Be Satisfied](/sound/ill-be-satisfied.m4a),” by Hezekiah Walker. I was watching a Cory Henry live stream and someone asks about his Gospel influences, and Henry just starts going on a 10-minute crash course of what you need to know. And he said that this live Hezekiah Walker album, _Live in New York_ — he said it’s the _Thriller_ of gospel albums. The definitive live recording. So I’ve been checking that out, and I think “I’ll Be Satisfied” is the most popular song on that album. It is _completely_ jamming. Great bass playing, great chord changes.

##### What was your first instrument?

Suzuki violin — little, little one. I don’t think I’ve ever been more stoked about a material object. I’d just stare at it. Must’ve been first grade, kindergarten? I was just completely obsessed with how it looked. And then I promptly quit.

##### You wanted to play it?

Yeah. I wanted to do it. Big time. But I didn’t know what Suzuki was, and I quit shortly into it, because they made you stand the whole lesson. So I could not handle.

##### Why violin?

I think I really wanted to play an instrument. I think saxophone. And my dad said I couldn’t start that until I was thirteen, for some reason. I think they knew that kids love saxophone because of the way it _looks_. So I think the only proven thing for kids that young was Suzuki. Can’t go and take private lessons for a first grader, it’s just not going to end well. So I think that’s how it happened.

I don’t think I was telling my parents, “I want to play violin.”

I do know the day it got there, it was in its case in a room, and I wasn’t allowed to see it until the lesson, and I snuck in and just messed around with it.

It was all just about an obsession with the way stuff _looked_. I didn’t care about the sound.

##### What happened to it after you quit?

It was a rental. My parents were smart about that. I still love the idea of those tiny violins. It’s a good look. It’s a ~_good_~ look. I know people who are successful at Suzuki do really well, they have good ears. It’s a really good method. Darren Criss was a Suzuki kid.

##### You ever think about playing violin again after that?

No.

After interviewing Jack, I wanted to fact-check a few of his claims, so I sent an email to Jack’s father, Bert Stratton, who wrote back immediately with some disenheartening news. (§:intro)

“I don’t remember it all.” (§:intro)

But after consulting his home-video log, Bert unearthed some confirmation and some contradiction. Inspired by the example of his older sister (notably absent from Jack’s narrative), Jack did in fact begin a Suzuki violin course in the fall of 1991. However, earlier that year — 3/1/91, to be precise, when Jack was three-and-a-half — he sat in on drums with the Yiddishe Cup Klezmer Band, his father’s klezmer outfit, at the Beachwood Public Library.[^theo] (§:intro)

And why wasn’t Jack allowed to play saxophone until he was thirteen? Bert — a saxophonist himself — said he couldn’t remember exactly, though was happy to speculate. (§:intro)

“I have a bias against saxophone, because some kids take it up because it’s shiny and sexy-looking.  Saxophone should be an acquired taste, something you get into after bar mitzvah age.” (§:intro)

[^theo]: Attentive readers may note that [Theo Katzman](/theo-katzman) also sat in on drums with his father at 3 & 1½ years old.
