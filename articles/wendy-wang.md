∂Wendy Wang is a musician, composer, and Los Angeles native. Her work has appeared in movies and on television, and she has performed with, produced, and engineered for a who’s-who of excellent musicians. The first time I saw her perform was at the Hi-Hat, a new venue in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, with her band, The Sweet Hurt. (§:intro)

##### What was the last thing you listened to?

I think it was a [Kacey Musgraves](/sound/musgraves.mp3) song. Some friends were like, “Oh, you gotta check her out.” But I didn’t know she was an artist until a couple days ago. So I was like, “Ok, yeah.”

##### Do you listen to a lot of country music?

Not really, so I tried to go into it with an open mind. Right away when you listen to it, there are certain aesthetics that are very different from other things I would naturally be drawn to. But there were some really nice songs I liked.

##### What was your first instrument?

I went to my first piano lesson when I was four. So piano is my first instrument. And I remember the first song I ever learned, I’ll always remember how to play it. It was in one of those stock books, this red book that was landscape. I just thought it was fun, I was like, “It’s like a video game! You _see_ that, and you _do_ that.”

##### Did you want to play piano in particular?

I think my parents just signed me up, but I was excited for the opportunity, because my older sisters had been playing, and I was like, _I want to try it out, too._

##### What was the actual piano you played on?

An upright Kimball, I think. I guess probably like a student model piano. It wasn’t a tall one, maybe... three-quarters? I don’t know the exact “categories” of pianos are.

##### Do you still play piano?

I do, yeah. But I quit lessons when I was twelve years old, and I remember at the time thinking, _I’m never going to get any better at this, this is not fun._ The pieces got harder and I was like, _I don’t want to practice these songs._ But, I started taking lessons again earlier this year.

##### What prompted that?

I was listening to a lot of R&B and thinking, _Wow, this harmony is— it’s not straight-ahead jazz, it’s not straight classical stuff._ I was interested in how people were figuring out those voicings, and I thought it was beautiful. And I knew players who could play like that, so I started asking them.

##### Now that you’re a musician, piano lessons have to be fairly different right?

Yeah, now I go in and I have more questions. I ask for more information. And I’m just more excited about going. And I’ll actually practice.

##### What was your first instrument that was really yours?

I’d say guitar was the first one. We had an exchange student living with us, when I was in middle school. He was from Switzerland, and he had a friend who was a musician, from the local high school, who lent him a guitar. So when he wasn’t playing it, I would ask him, “Can I play your guitar?” I ended up just taking it over and playing for hours every day. So that’s when I knew I was _really_ into something. I was like, “I _do_ want to practice, I _do_ want to get better at something.”

##### So that was your first musical instrument right after piano?

Well, there was also clarinet in school band. Clarinet always confused me; I was like, “well, you just play one note at a time.” One note at a time was so foreign to me, being a pianist. But then I was like, _well, alright, you play with a group of people, I get it_. But I never thought, _I’m going to learn how to solo on this thing and write duets for the clarinet._

##### Do you remember what kind of guitar it was?

It was a nylon string. But the funny thing was, there was no high E string on it.

##### So it was a five string guitar?

Yeah, it was a five string guitar. I remember going to my next door neighbors’ house and they had a guitar and I was like, _Oh my gosh, they have the E string!_ and then I started playing a Stone Temple Pilots song that required that note.

##### You knew your guitar was missing that string?

Yeah! I would practicie as if it were there.

##### But it seemed like an impossibility that you would add the string?

Yeah, I looked at the mechanics and I was like, _I don’t know how this works_, and it wasn’t my guitar. About a year later, my mom got me a guitar, a classical guitar, with all six strings on it.
